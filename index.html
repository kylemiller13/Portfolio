  <h3 class="me">About me</h3>
  <div class="me">
    <p class="me">As a Californian, I grew up all along Southern California and after 
        graduating high school, I moved to Texas to continue school 
        at a community college while working at a resturant as a buser. 
        After a year of schooling, my family decided that Texas wasn't a 
        great fit for us and moved to Portland, Oregon.</p>
    <p class="me">Currently, I'm a student at Portland Community College pursuing
        my Associate's degree in General Studies. I always had a passion 
        about computer's and how they worked. Having taken a abundance of classes
        to try and find what I like, I stumbled upon a programming class. I quickly 
        enjoyed it and liked how infuriating and fustrating it was because it
        made me want to learn more about it. </p>
    <p class="me">When COVID hit it quickly changed how schoolings worked and everything was
        remote. It became harder to learn because the schooling structure wasn't
        perpared so I decided to hold off of school.</p>
    <p class="me">Around that time, I looked into coding bootcamps and did a couple intro to
        programming classes at some schools and finally came to a conclusion that 
        Epidocus was a great fit for me.</p>
