      I think what best represents me is a really great book. 
      I'm wise and helpful that can enhance people’s lives just
      by being in it – like a really good book.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      As a Californian, I grew up all along Southern California and after
      graduating high school, I moved to Texas to continue school 
      at a community college while working at a resturant as a buser. 
      After a year of school, my family decided that Texas wasn't a 
      great fit for us and moved to Portland, Oregon.
      <br>
      </br>
      Currently, I'm a student at Portland Community College pursuing
      my Associate's degree in General Studies. I always had a passion 
      about computer's and how they worked. Having taken a abundance of classes
      to try and find what I like, I stumbled upon a programming class. I quickly 
      enjoyed it and liked how infuriating and fustrating it was because it
      made me want to learn more about it.
      <br>
      </br>
      When COVID hit, it quickly changed how schools worked and everything was
      remote. It became harder to learn because the structure wasn't
      perpared better so I decided to hold off of school.
      <br>
      </br>
      Around that time, I looked into coding bootcamps and did a couple intro to
      programming classes at some schools and finally came to a conclusion that 
      Epidocus was a great fit for me.

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    I usually spend my leisure time producing electronic music since I was
    in high school and playing an abudance of sports like golf, basketball, pickle ball, etc. 
    Along with this, I also like going out on long walks with my dog named Scout.
