  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    As a Californian, I grew up all along Southern California and after
    graduating high school, I moved to Texas to continue school 
    at a community college while working at a resturant as a buser. 
    After a year of schooling, my family decided that Texas wasn't a 
    great fit for us and moved to Portland, Oregon.
    <br>
    </br>
    Currently, I'm a student at Portland Community College pursuing
    my Associate's degree in General Studies. I always had a passion 
    about computer's and how they worked. Having taken a abundance of classes
    to try and find what I like, I stumbled upon a programming class. I quickly 
    enjoyed it and liked how infuriating and fustrating it was because it
    made me want to learn more about it.
    <br>
    </br>
    When COVID hit it quickly changed how schoolings worked and everything was
    remote. It became harder to learn because the schooling structure wasn't
    perpared so I decided to hold off of school.
    <br>
    </br>
    Around that time, I looked into coding bootcamps and did a couple intro to
    programming classes at some schools and finally came to a conclusion that 
    Epidocus was a great fit for me.
